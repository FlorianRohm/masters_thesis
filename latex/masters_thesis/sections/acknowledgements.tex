First and foremost, I would like to thank Prof.\ Dr.\ Barbara Wohlmuth for bringing the field of Lattice Boltzmann methods to my attention, giving me the possibility to write this thesis and travel to Erlangen for further knowledge transfer.
Furthermore, I'd like to thank Ehsan Fattahi Evati for the continuing guidance and the countless informative and interesting conversations.

For the incredibly fast and insightful email responses, I would like Prof.\ Dr.\ Martin Geier, who is coincidentally also one of the inventors of the three-dimensional version of this method.

Additionally, I would like to thank my family, girlfriend and friends for their support during the writing of the thesis.
Here, I would like to point out Dr.\ Ute Rosenbaum and Alexander Zeilmann for their merciless proofreading.
