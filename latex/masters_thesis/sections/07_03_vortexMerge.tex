For the final set of simulations, we have to introduce the Rankine-vortex.
It is an idealized model of a vortex, mixing the definitions of a rigid body vortex
with constant vorticity and a potential vortex which has infinite vorticity in its center and zero otherwise.

  \caption{Cut through the middle of a Rankine vortex.
  The inner part is a rigid body vortex with constant vorticity, whereas the outer part is a potential vortex which is vorticity free in this area.}
\label{fig: rankine}
\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig: rankine} shows the $y$ component of the velocity when cutting through a Rankine vortex at $y=0$, the $x$ component is zero.
A more thorough description of the Rankine vortex can be found in~\cite{giaiotti2006rankine}.

The most simple nontrivial setting is depicted in Figure~\ref{fig: vortex merge setup} and consists of two vortices next to each other with the same direction of rotation, in our case conterclockwise, i.e.\ with positive vorticity.
