After stating how to get into the space of normalized cumulants and backwards, we have to elaborate the collision itself.
For this, we're going to go back to our trusted Maxwell distribution~\eqref{eq: maxwell distribution raw}, and transform it to the space of cumulants.
There, we will relax the (normalized) cumulants according to some relaxation rates $\omega_i$ to get our post-collision (normalized) cumulants which we the transform back as stated in the last section.
