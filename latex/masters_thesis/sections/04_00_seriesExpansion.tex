After presenting the method, we prove that it satisfies the Navier-Stokes equations with second order accuracy.

To achieve this goal, we will have to perform a Taylor expansion on the discrete equation and an additional asymptotic expansion of the moments.
The desired equations will arise when looking at the low order terms of the asymptotic expansion.
