For implementing the cumulant LBM, we also need to get normalized cumulants from central moments, as we want to have the collision in the cumulant space.
Coming from~\eqref{eq: all central moments from cumulants} this is an easy task.
Nevertheless, we have to distinguish between the different equations in~\eqref{eq: all central moments from cumulants}.
The first three can not be inverted and thus the corresponding cumulants have to be computed from the moments $m_{00}$, $m_{10}$ and $m_{01}$ with equations~\eqref{eq: definition of kappa_00} to~\eqref{eq: definition of kappa_01}.
Those moments are needed anyway for the central moment computation.
All other but the last equation in~\eqref{eq: all central moments from cumulants} are inverted straightforward.
Inserting the resulting equations for $\kappa_{11}$, $\kappa_{02}$ and $\kappa_{20}$ in the last equation, we get
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq: all cumulants from central moments}
  \begin{aligned}
    \kappa_{00} & = \ln(m_{00})\\
    \kappa_{10} & = \frac{m_{10}}{m_{00}} \\
    \kappa_{01} & = \frac{m_{01}}{m_{00}} \\
    \kappa_{20} & = \frac{c_{20}}{m_{00}} \\
    \kappa_{02} & = \frac{c_{02}}{m_{00}} \\
    \kappa_{11} & = \frac{c_{11}}{m_{00}} \\
    \kappa_{21} & = \frac{c_{21}}{m_{00}} \\
    \kappa_{12} & = \frac{c_{12}}{m_{00}} \\
    \kappa_{22} & = \frac{c_{22}}{m_{00}} - 2{\left(\frac{c_{11}}{m_{00}}\right)}^2 - \frac{c_{20}}{m_{00}}\frac{c_{02}}{m_{00}}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

or with the normalized cumulants
\begin{equation}
  \begin{aligned}
    \label{eq: all normalized cumulants from central moments}
    K_{00} & = \ln(m_{00})m_{00} \\
    K_{10} & = m_{10} \\
    K_{01} & = m_{01} \\
    K_{20} & = c_{20} \\
    K_{02} & = c_{02} \\
    K_{11} & = c_{11} \\
    K_{21} & = c_{21} \\
    K_{12} & = c_{12} \\
    K_{22} & = c_{22} - 2 \frac{{c_{11}}^2}{m_{00}} - \frac{c_{20}c_{02}}{m_{00}}.
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
