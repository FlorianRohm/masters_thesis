This section will finalize the analysis of the proposed method which begun in Section~\ref{sec: Series expansions}.

As noted in the last section, we want to derive the Navier-Stokes momentum equations\footnote{Some will say, it's \textbf{the} momentum equation, stating it's one vectorial equation.
As we need the individual components, we try to stick with the other convention, calling it the momentum equation\textbf{s}.} for compressible flows.
Considering that, the first part will again state the desired equations, before we dive into the derivation in the second part.
