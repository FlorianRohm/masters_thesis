Our goal in this little section is the derivation of the continuity equation.

Upon looking at the equations derived in Section~\ref{sub: Matching the coefficients}, we see that our first nontrivial equation is for $\epsilon^2$, namely~\eqref{eq: second order in epsilon}.
Choosing $\alpha=\beta=0$ and using that the first order terms are collision invariant,~\eqref{eq: first order collision invariant}, we get
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      \partial_t m_{00}^{(0)} + m_{00}^{(2)} & =  m_{00}^{*(2)} - \partial_x m_{10}^{*(1)} - \partial_y m_{01}^{*(1)} \\
      \equivalent \qquad \partial_t m_{00}^{(0)} & =  - \partial_x m_{10}^{*(1)} - \partial_y m_{01}^{*(1)} \\
      & =  - \partial_x m_{10}^{(1)} - \partial_y m_{01}^{(1)}.
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Inserting now the macroscopic values for the moments, we get
\begin{equation}
  \partial_t \rho^{(0)} + \nabla (\rho^{(1)} \mathbf{v}^{(1)}) = 0.
\end{equation}
This is the conservation of mass even \textbf{without} the assumption of incompressibility.
Winged by this finding, we will also try to get the compressible version of the momentum equation in the following section.
